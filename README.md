# HezekiahWebsite

Welcome to my very first website! In an effort to learn and expand my coding ability, I made this very basic site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I kept this simple and sleek, and prioritized learning, troubleshooting, and designing a website from start to finish as the main priorities. I began this project with a blank sheet and wrote hundreds of lines of code to create a home, about, and contact page that works without any issue (hopefully!). </br>

Next, I hope to add on pages under the about section (instead of returning the user to the home screen) with annectdotes, papers, and other research or commentary I write in the future. I also hope to change the design of the website and build out the automatic email contact when the user presses submit on the contact page. </br>

This is a work in progress that I edit during my free time outside of work, and I am excited to welcome you to my project! Feel free to add any comments or share fun website animations that you recommend :)
